# Hello everyone

I'm [Lukáš Kovář](https://programovaciweb.tk).

I am a 20 years old student of IT 💻.
I started learning programming 👨‍💻 and web development 5 years ago. I had a school project with my friends under team name Louťáci http://loutiot.cz/.

Today I am primarily focused on programming in JavaScript and Node.js and sometimes helping people with their PHP and WordPress. I know React and some Vue.js.
Here is my example game “Lodě” (sea battle) https://lode.netlify.app/, which I have build in 2019 with the use of **React**, **Redux** and websocket server run on **Node.js**. 

I am quite busy at the moment, I work in Unicorn as a part-time JavaScript developer and have few other contracts.
You can decide what should I do after completing maturita exam 😉.
