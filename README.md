# Hello everyone

I'm [Lukáš Kovář](https://lukaskovar.com).

I am a 20 years old "student" of IT 💻.
I do programming and web development 👨‍💻 and web development for over 5 years.

My primary focus is programming in JavaScript, Node.js and sometimes helping people with their PHP and WordPress. Most of the apps I wrote is written in React.
Here is my example game “Lodě” (sea battle) https://lode.lukaskovar.com/, which I have build in with the use of **React**, **Redux** and **Websockets** server runs **Node.js**, it's opensourced under my repo. 

I have project with my friends under team name Louťáci http://loutiot.cz/.

You can decide what should I do next 😉.
