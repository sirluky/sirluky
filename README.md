# Hello everyone

I'm [Lukáš Kovář](https://lukaskovar.com).

I am a 20 years old student of IT 💻.
I started learning programming 👨‍💻 and web development 5 years ago.

My primary focus is programming in JavaScript, Node.js and sometimes helping people with their PHP and WordPress. Most of the apps I wrote is written in React.
Here is my example game “Lodě” (sea battle) https://lode.lukaskovar.com/, which I have build in 2019 with the use of **React**, **Redux** and **websockets** server runs **Node.js**. 

I have project with my friends under team name Louťáci http://loutiot.cz/.

I am helping [Tangle.cz](https://tangle.cz) to make lights interactive and easily controllable.
You can decide what should I do next 😉.
