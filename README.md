# Hello everyone

I'm [Lukáš Kovář](https://lukaskovar.com).

I am a 23 years old IT Guy 💻.
I do programming and web development 👨‍💻 and web app development 👨‍💻👨‍💻 for over 5 years.

My primary focus is programming in JavaScript (TS), Node.js and sometimes helping people with their PHP and WordPress. Most of the apps I wrote is written in React.

I am working at [Spectoda](https://spectoda.com) to make lights interactive and easily controllable.
Let's see what we build.
